create patch:
  diff old new -crw # c: context r: recursive w: ignore white spaces

patch blob:
  patch -p0 < [patch.diff] # p: extrac path, if same path level, etc.

notice:
  In patch CWD, there must not be the NEW blob, otherwise patch will operate the NEW one! Alternatively, can substitute NEW with OLD of [patch.diff].
